# Ktor-UrlShortener

Here is a simple url shortener written in Ktor. There is nothing too special about it but it does log each use of a specific url. Empowr created this to mitigate cost of using a paid url shortener with a custom domain name.

This is meant to be hosted on AWS but you can host this anywhere a fatJar is used.
